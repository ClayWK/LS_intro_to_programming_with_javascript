// In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check whether their 
// return values differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality 
// comparisons to read about how == and === differ.

'8' == 8; // => true
'8' === 8; // => false

// The loose equality operator checks whether two values are equal, and if they are not of the same type,
// will coerce one to the type of the other and then check whether they are identical.

// The strict equality operator checks whether two values are compltely identical, including checking that
// the two values have the same type.
