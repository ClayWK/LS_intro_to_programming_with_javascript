// What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream("Yipeee");

// Nothing. There is no console.log statement.  The return statement alone doesn't log anything to the console.
// If we ran the code in a REPL, it would show the return statement of Yipeee!!!!
